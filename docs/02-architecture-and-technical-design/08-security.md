# 8. SCC Protocol Security Plan

Security is the top priority and an ongoing process in the SCC project. This document describes the practices, tools, and procedures implemented to ensure the security of user funds and the robustness of the protocol.

## 8.1. Testing Methodology

The protocol uses the Foundry framework for an exhaustive test suite, complemented by tests for off-chain services:

*   **Unit Tests:** Verify the isolated behavior of each contract function (Forge).
*   **Integration Tests:** Evaluate the interactions between different contracts (Forge).
*   **Forking Tests:** Simulate the mainnet to test interactions with real external protocols (Forge).
*   **Property-Based Tests (Fuzzing):** Explore extreme and unexpected cases to find vulnerabilities (Foundry Fuzzing Engine).
*   **Off-chain Services Tests:** Ensure the robustness and business logic of keepers and bots, using Jest for unit and integration tests (detailed in `offchain/docs/TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## 8.2. Code Analysis and Metrics

*   **Static Analysis:** Tools like Slither are integrated into CI/CD to detect known vulnerability patterns.
*   **Code Coverage:** A test coverage target of over 95% is maintained, with reports generated by `forge coverage`.

## 8.3. Security Audits

*   **External Audits:** The protocol will undergo at least two full audits by independent and reputable security firms before its mainnet launch.
*   **Peer Review:** Every Pull Request requires the review and approval of at least one other member of the development team.

## 8.4. Access Control and Key Management (Post-Deployment)

To ensure decentralization and post-deployment security, no externally owned account (EOA) will have direct control over the protocol:

*   **Contract Ownership:** All upgradeable contracts and contracts with critical parameters will be owned by a `TimelockController` contract.
*   **Timelock Administration:** The sole administrator of the `TimelockController` will be a `Gnosis Safe (Multisig)`.
*   **Multisig Configuration:** The multisig wallet will be configured with a quorum of 3 out of 5 signers, composed of key team members and trusted advisors.
*   **Key Management:** All multisig signers must use hardware wallets and keep their recovery keys in secure, offline locations.

## 8.5. Post-Launch Plan

*   **Bug Bounty:** Launch of a bug bounty program on platforms like Immunefi, with significant rewards to encourage the discovery and responsible reporting of vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitoring and Alerts:** 24/7 monitoring using tools like Tenderly and Forta for real-time alerts on suspicious or anomalous activities in the contracts.
