# MVP Scope Document

**Project:** Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoin (SCC)
**Version:** 0.1
**Status:** Active

## 1. Introduction

This document aims to clearly define the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the SCC Protocol. Defining a clear MVP is crucial to focus development, testing, and auditing efforts on the essential functionality for a safe and successful launch.

It draws the line between the core product to be launched and subsequent growth and expansion strategies.

## 2. MVP Components (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP consists of a fully functional, secure, and community-governed collateralized lending protocol. It must be able to operate autonomously and demonstrate its full revenue cycle.

### 2.1. Core Lending Functionality

-   **Vault Creation:** Deployment of `VaultFactory` to allow users to create their own `Vaults` (debt positions).
-   **Collateral and Debt Management:** Full functionality in `Vaults` to:
    -   Deposit a single type of collateral (e.g., WETH).
    -   Mint the `SCC-USD` stablecoin.
    -   Repay debt (`burn`) with `SCC-USD`.
    -   Withdraw collateral.
-   **Fundamental Tokens:** Fully implemented `SCC-USD` (ERC20) and `SCC-GOV` (ERC20Votes) contracts.

### 2.2. Security and Solvency Mechanisms

-   **Price Oracles:** The `OracleManager` integrated with the Chainlink mainnet to provide reliable and secure prices for the initial collateral asset.
-   **Liquidations:** The fully functional `LiquidationManager`, using Dutch Auctions to ensure the protocol's solvency efficiently.
-   **Robust Access Control:** Full implementation of the hybrid access control architecture (Timelock, RBAC, Capabilities) to protect administrative functions.

### 2.3. Governance and Value Capture

-   **Governance Cycle:** The operational `SCC_Governor` and `TimelockController`, allowing `SCC-GOV` holders to create proposals, vote, and execute changes in the protocol in a decentralized manner.
-   **Revenue Distribution:** The functional `StakingPool`, capable of receiving fees generated by the protocol and distributing them to `SCC-GOV` stakers.

## 3. Post-MVP Components (Growth Strategies)

These components are planned to be developed and implemented after the successful launch and stabilization of the MVP. They are detailed in the `05-DeFi_Strategies.md` document.

### 3.1. Phase 1: Launch and Liquidity (Immediate Post-Launch)

-   **Focus:** Make `SCC-USD` useful and accessible.
-   **Initiatives:**
    -   Creation of a primary liquidity pool on Curve Finance (`SCC-USD`/`3CRV`).
    -   Launch of incentive programs (`Liquidity Mining`) to attract liquidity providers.

### 3.2. Phase 2: Expansion and Utility (Short to Medium Term)

-   **Focus:** Increase the scale and utility of `SCC-USD`.
-   **Initiatives:**
    -   **Collateral Expansion:** Add support for new assets, such as `wBTC` and Liquid Staking Tokens (`LSTs`).
    -   **Ecosystem Integration:** List `SCC-USD` on money markets (e.g., Aave, Compound).

### 3.3. Phase 3: Protocol Evolution (Long Term)

-   **Focus:** Solidify the protocol's market position and explore new frontiers.
-   **Initiatives:**
    -   Implementation of a Peg Stability Module (**PSM**).
    -   Research and development for the integration of Real World Assets (**RWA**).
    -   Creation of a permanent liquidity reserve through Protocol Owned Liquidity (**POL**).
