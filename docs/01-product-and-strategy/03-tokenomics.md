# 3. Tokenomics (SCC-GOV)

This document details the tokenomics of **SCC-GOV**, the governance and utility token of the SCC protocol. `SCC-GOV` is designed to facilitate decentralized governance, align incentives among ecosystem participants, and capture the value generated by the protocol.

## 3.1. Token Utility

`SCC-GOV` has the following main utilities:

1.  **Governance:**
    *   `SCC-GOV` holders can vote on proposals that change critical system parameters, such as the Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR), Stability Fee, addition of new collateral types, and allocation of treasury funds.
    *   Voting power is proportional to the amount of tokens staked or delegated.

2.  **Staking and Revenue Share:**
    *   Users can stake their `SCC-GOV` in the `StakingPool` contract to earn rewards in `SCC-USD`.
    *   A portion of the Stability Fees and other revenues generated by the protocol (e.g., liquidation fees) is distributed to `SCC-GOV` stakers, encouraging token retention and active participation in governance.

3.  **Ecosystem Incentives (Liquidity Mining):**
    *   `SCC-GOV` will be used to reward users who contribute to the health and liquidity of the protocol, such as liquidity providers for `SCC-USD` pools in AMMs.

## 3.2. Staking Implementation (`StakingPool.sol`)

The `StakingPool.sol` contract manages the `SCC-GOV` staking process and the distribution of rewards in `SCC-USD`.

### Key State Variables:

*   `stakingToken`: The `SCC-GOV` token that users deposit.
*   `rewardsToken`: The `SCC-USD` token distributed as a reward.
*   `staked[address]`: Maps the staker's address to the amount of `SCC-GOV` they have deposited.
*   `rewardPerTokenStored`: Total rewards per token accumulated since the contract's inception.
*   `rewardsDistribution`: Authorized address to distribute rewards (usually a governance or timelock contract).
*   `rewardRate`: The rate at which rewards are distributed per second.
*   `lastUpdateTime`: The last time rewards were updated.
*   `periodFinish`: Timestamp of when the current reward period ends.

### Main Functions:

*   **`stake(uint256 amount)`:** Allows a user to deposit `SCC-GOV` into the pool. The `amount` is transferred from the user to the contract, and the user's `staked` amount is updated. The `updateReward` function is called to calculate pending rewards before any change in the stake.
*   **`unstake(uint256 amount)`:** Allows a user to withdraw their `SCC-GOV` from the pool. The `amount` is transferred back to the user, and the `staked` amount is updated. It also calls `updateReward`.
*   **`getReward()`:** Allows a user to claim their accumulated rewards in `SCC-USD`. The `earned(msg.sender)` function calculates the reward, which is then transferred to the user. `userRewardPerTokenPaid` is updated to prevent the user from claiming the same reward again.
*   **`notifyRewardAmount(uint256 reward, uint256 duration)`:** Function called by `rewardsDistribution` to add new rewards to the pool. It adjusts `rewardRate` and `periodFinish` based on the new reward and duration, ensuring continuous distribution.
*   **`earned(address account)`:** `view` function that calculates the amount of rewards an account has earned but not yet claimed.

## 3.3. Total Supply and Allocation

**Total Supply (Max Supply):** 100,000,000 SCC-GOV

The allocation of `SCC-GOV` is distributed with a focus on long-term community control:

| Category                  | Percentage | Amount          | Vesting/Release Details                                     | Purpose                                                   |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Treasury**    | 40%        | 40,000,000      | Gradually released over 4 years. Controlled by governance. | Fund future development, grants, partnerships.            |
| **Incentives (Liquidity Mining)** | 30%        | 30,000,000      | Distributed via incentive programs over 3-4 years.        | Bootstrap liquidity and initial protocol adoption.        |
| **Team and Advisors**     | 20%        | 20,000,000      | 1-year cliff (full lock-up), followed by 3-year linear vesting. | Long-term incentive for the core team.                    |
| **Investors (Seed/Strategic)** | 10%        | 10,000,000      | 6-month cliff, followed by 2-year linear vesting.         | Initial capital for development and audits.               |
| **Total**                 | **100%**   | **100,000,000** |                                                             |                                                           |

## 3.4. Emission Schedule

The circulating supply of `SCC-GOV` is managed to avoid excessive selling pressure. Most of the initial issuance will come from Liquidity Mining programs. The token release schedule (vesting) for each category over 48 months is detailed in the table below:

| Month | Treasury (40M) | Incentives (30M) | Team (20M) | Investors (10M) | Total Released | Circulating Supply |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0   | 0    | 2.5M | 0    | 0    | 2.5M | 2.5M |
| 6   | 5M   | 6.25M| 0    | 2.08M| 13.33M | 15.83M |
