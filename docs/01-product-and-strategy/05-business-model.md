# 5. SCC Protocol Business Model

This document details the business model of the SCC Protocol, explaining how it generates revenue, captures value, and positions itself in the DeFi ecosystem. The protocol operates as a **decentralized bank**, where the main service is the issuance of loans (the `SCC-USD` stablecoin) against collateral assets deposited by users.

## 5.1. Revenue Sources

The protocol has two primary revenue sources:

### 5.1.1. Stability Fee

*   **Definition:** An annualized interest rate charged on all issued `SCC-USD` debt. This is the protocol's main source of revenue.
*   **Functioning:** The fee is continuously accumulated in each `Vault` with active debt and is paid by the user in `SCC-USD` when they repay their debt.
*   **Governance:** The Stability Fee amount is a crucial parameter controlled by governance (`SCC-GOV`), and can be adjusted to control the supply and demand of `SCC-USD` and optimize revenue.

### 5.1.2. Liquidation Penalty

*   **Definition:** A fee charged when a `Vault` becomes under-collateralized and is liquidated.
*   **Functioning:** During the liquidation process, the `Vault`'s collateral is auctioned to cover the debt. The penalty is an additional amount charged on the debt, serving as a secondary revenue source and as a disincentive for high-risk positions.

## 5.2. Value Capture (The Role of SCC-GOV)

The `SCC-GOV` token is fundamental to the business model, as it allows token holders to benefit from the revenue generated by the protocol.

*   **Value Flow:**
    1.  Stability Fees and Liquidation Penalties are collected by the protocol.
    2.  This revenue (in `SCC-USD`) is transferred to the `StakingPool` contract.
    3.  `SCC-GOV` holders can deposit (`stake`) their tokens in the `StakingPool`.
    4.  The `StakingPool` distributes the accumulated revenue proportionally to all stakers.

This mechanism transforms `SCC-GOV` into a **productive asset**, whose value is directly linked to the revenue generated by the protocol. The more `SCC-USD` is issued and the more fees are collected, the higher the yield for `SCC-GOV` stakers.

## 5.3. Benchmarking and Success Models

The SCC Protocol's business model is inspired and validated by successful projects in the DeFi space:

*   **MakerDAO (DAI & MKR):** A pioneer in collateralized stablecoins, with a model of `Vaults`, Stability Fees, and a governance token (`MKR`) that captures value, generating significant revenue.
*   **Liquity (LUSD & LQTY):** Another ETH-collateralized stablecoin protocol that distributes protocol revenue to the stakers of its governance token (`LQTY`).
